        <div class="blog-content-div">
            <p>
                Sustainability is defined by 3 Ps – People, Planet and Profit. To build a sustainable future, the materials, especially metals we use play a crucial role. And that’s because discarded or scrap metal do not decompose easily and that
                poses
                a serious risk to people and planet. To have a sustainable tomorrow, we need to use metals that are clean, durable and recyclable today.

            </p>
            <p> Currently, a lot of emphasis is laid on choosing materials that are sustainable and stainless steel, known best for its sustainability and durability properties is gaining significant recognition. Stainless steel sheets have been used
                for
                a long time for various applications across various industries and is known to be 100% recyclable. It is therefore the right material for a sustainable planet. Not only do stainless steel products help in implementing
                environment-friendly
                solutions, it also helps in implementing cost effective solutions as well. Let’s have a look at the various aspects that contribute to the role of stainless steel in sustainability:
            </p>

            <strong>Stainless Steel is 100% Recyclable</strong>

            <p>Stainless Steel is non-degradable and 100% recyclable. Therefore, it is recycled to produce more steel and this process goes on indefinitely. The material is made of nickel, iron, chromium, and molybdenum among other raw materials.
                These
                metals are high in demand and therefore stainless steel has high capture rates. Despite extremely high recapture rates, the demand for stainless steel is on the rise, which is an excellent trend because it helps to ensure that the new
                stainless steel that goes into production today will be recycled in the future.
            </p>

            <strong>Stainless Steel is Durable</strong>
            <p>Due to its excellent mechanical and corrosion properties, stainless steel is chosen for countless applications across various industries because it ensures low maintenance costs, a long life and high recapture rates once that life is
                over. Companies can foster its high sustainability and durability properties by implementing a proper maintenance system with a commitment to recycle steel and purchase recycled steel whenever the need arises.
            </p>

            <strong>Stainless Steel Doesn’t Pose a Risk to Human Health</strong>
            <p>Stainless steel is easy to clean and does not breed bacteria easily. Therefore, it is widely used in manufacturing of food and medicine. The presence of chromium in stainless steel forms a natural, passive protective layer that
                prevents
                steel from corroding. Therefore, if the correct grade of steel is chosen for an application it poses little to no risk to the people handling it. Moreover, it becomes an environment-friendly choice as 100% of it is recycled at the end
                of
                its life. An important fact to note here is that stainless steel does not remain in the environment and poses no threat to humans and animals.
            </p>

            <strong>
                Stainless Steel Makes a Perfect Economical Choice</strong>
            <p> Stainless steel doesn’t only make an excellent environmental choice, but it is an excellent economical choice as well. If the correct type or grade of stainless steel is chosen for an application, it can last till the project lasts.
                In
                its lifetime, it saves maintenance costs, inspection costs and production downtime costs. Because of its high durability properties, it can sustain in the worst of conditions and retain its original form. At the end of a project, the
                stainless steel also has a high scrap value and all of it is recycled.
            </p>
            <p>With the onset of environmental awareness, people, government, commercial establishments, communities and industries have realized the need to reduce carbon footprints to have a sustainable future. They are now more conscious than ever
                about their choices in materials as they do not want to contribute to the carbon emissions that could paralyze nature. They would rather invest in looking for better ways to ensure that their products are environmentally friendly and
                do
                not cause harm to people and nature. The growing amount of awareness has made stainless steel the material of choice. It is no wonder that stainless steel is deemed as a green product and the demand for this material has been the
                highest
                of any material in the world.</p>
